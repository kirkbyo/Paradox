                  <h4>Outflow</h4>
                  <p>Outflow was created because of how hard it was to keep track of all your subscriptions. The app was created with the main idea to have a simple easy place to manage all your growing number of subscriptions.</p>
                  <p>Created over a period of six months and was our first big project. Over that period of time, we overcame several design and engineering decisions that almost prevented us from creating the app you see.</p>
